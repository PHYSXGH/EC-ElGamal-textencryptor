In 2019, a 4 core CPU is relatively small. When this segment was established, mainstream dual-socket servers had 4 to 8 cores per CPU. Now, we see 64 cores in a single CPU socket and 4 seems very small, especially when virtualization is widely accepted. Still, there is a market for a bare minimum CPU where a single physical server is needed. While the Xeon E-2200 series with the Xeon E-2288G can put 8 cores into a single socket, there is additional competition from the Intel Core i3-9100 at the low end. If one needs minimal CPU performance at a lower cost, then there are other options.
